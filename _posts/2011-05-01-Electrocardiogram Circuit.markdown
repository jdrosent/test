# Motivation
For my junior-year EE design course at the [University of Minnesota][minnesota], we were tasked with designing a circuit that could measure and output the waveform of your heartbeat (aka EKG signals).
As a group of four students, we developed a system from initial concept, simulation, and breadboard prototype to PCB. Our final system was milled on a two-layer piece of copper-clad FR-4, and an socilloscope was used
to display the EKG signal of one us students.

# How it works
The system is based on an instrumentation circuit from Texas Instruments that uses an instrumentation amplifier and active filters to measure the EKG signals while rejecting the strong 60 Hz noise from the surrounding laboratory environment.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find all of my documentation on the system, but I will update this whenever I find the materials!
